Thesis: Study of the Temperature Dependent Electron Mobility in GaN/ScAlN Heterostructures
## Abstract
III-nitride semiconductor heterostructures have emerged as critical materials for next-generation
electronic devices. Structures such as AlGaN/GaN and ScAlN/GaN demonstrate significant
promise for high-power, high-frequency, and high-temperature applications. Their distinctive
material properties address the growing demand for more efficient electronic components. This
thesis investigates electron transport mechanisms in AlGaN/GaN and ScAlN/GaN
heterostructures through a combination of Poisson-Schr√∂dinger solvers and Boltzmann transport
calculations, focusing on the influence of polarization effects and scattering mechanisms on
carrier mobility. The findings highlight a key design trade-off: ScAlN/GaN enables higher carrier
densities, enhancing current handling capabilities, whereas AlGaN/GaN offers superior carrier
mobility, making it more suitable for high-frequency performance.
